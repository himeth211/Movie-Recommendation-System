# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project aims to build an Movie Recommendation System that provides rcommendations for the chosen movie. Through the analysis of a pre-existing database, or via web scraping. Namely, the project uses web scraping to universally identify movies, clustering for categorisation and the application of cosine similarity to identify suitable matches for a movie.
